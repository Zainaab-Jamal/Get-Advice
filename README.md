# My React Vite App

This is a simple React application built using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Fetches advice from an API.
- Displays the advice along with the count of advices fetched.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
